Loans from consumer finance companies are less dangerous for borrowers than payday and auto title loans in three important ways. First, they have much smaller payments, which are affordable for typical consumers. Second, their interest rates are lower. And third, they are based more on the borrowers’ ability to repay than on the model used in the payday and auto title market: a lender’s ability to collect, in which the lender obtains access to the borrower’s checking account or vehicle title.
